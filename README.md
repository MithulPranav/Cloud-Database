# Cloud-Database
Integration of cloud database for IoT devices

Cloud Database: Ubidots

Device: ESP32

Sensor used: DHT

Pin: 17

Values Read: Temperature, Humidity and Heatsink

  The values are read using the DHT sensor in the ESP32(sensor node) and the data is sent using MQTT to the Ubidots server and the data is stored in the Ubidots database. In a similar way other devices like WEMOS, Raspberry Pi can also be connected to cloud database.
